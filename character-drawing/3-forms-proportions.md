# 3. Character Forms and Proportions

## Introduction
- learning shorthand forms to get up to speed
- build your own character forms
- forms are here before shape?
  - the next module is about gesture
  - remember that implementation model? forms + shapes are at the same time
  - be like a sculptor and then infuse shape into what you formed realistically
  - shape as molding forms
- revisit these ideas often because drawing forms is basis for dynamism
- "dynamic forms" as the critical concept
- anatomy is not equal to character design
  - characters have anatomy
  - _but_ so much of anatomy is part of the detail section
  - it's really about making forms not getting detailed anatomy
- complex anatomy can be learned by rote
  - lots of observational studies

## Proportions 1
- ideal body proportions
  - size, spacing, location
  - it's a ruleset (really guidelines)
  - manipulate proportions to get different styles or "looks"
  - learn by heark: stick your proportions somewhere you see every day
- capture measurements for believability
  - based on head size
  - 8-head system as a typical height
1. head to chin
2. chin to nipple line
3. nipple line to navel line
4. navel line to crotch
5. (hips - to mid thigh)
6. mid thigh to bottom of knee
7. (to mid shin)
8. bottom of feet
- width: shoulder is 2.5-3.0 * head width
- arms: elbow at bottom of rib cage or slightly above navel line
- hands: halfway on the hips
- male: taller, female: shorter (7.0-7.5 heads)
- male: broad shoulders and narrow hips; female: narrow shoulders and broad hips
  - this isn't to be exact but is symbolic
  - this has to do with pelvis structure
  - great trochanter tends to be out further in females

## Proportions 2
- idealistic head proportions
- remember location of facial elements
0. circle with vertical centerline; divide horizontally into three parts
1. that second bottom-most line is the eye line
2. duplicate the 2/3 space above the eye line to below to find chin line
3. draw a chin shape pulling tangents from the circle down to chin line
4. indicate oval eyes around the eye line, placed in the middle of each half
    - this leaves one eye space between eyes
    - it also leaves 3/4 eye space on the side of each eye
5. the bottom of the circle becomes the nose bottom
6. divide space between bottom of nose and chin into three
    - top third is mouth line
7. indicate eyebrows half an eye or 3/4 eye height above the eyes
8. ears go bottom of nose to top of eyebrows
- these are "general hint proportions"
  - relatively normal characters
- circle first instead of ovular
  - we can create different jaw shapes
  - we can still use those rules to find face lines for stylized characters!

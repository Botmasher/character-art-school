# 3. Character Forms and Proportions

## Introduction
- learning shorthand forms to get up to speed
- build your own character forms
- forms are here before shape?
  - the next module is about gesture
  - remember that implementation model? forms + shapes are at the same time
  - be like a sculptor and then infuse shape into what you formed realistically
  - shape as molding forms
- revisit these ideas often because drawing forms is basis for dynamism
- "dynamic forms" as the critical concept
- anatomy is not equal to character design
  - characters have anatomy
  - _but_ so much of anatomy is part of the detail section
  - it's really about making forms not getting detailed anatomy
- complex anatomy can be learned by rote
  - lots of observational studies

## Proportions 1
- ideal body proportions
  - size, spacing, location
  - it's a ruleset (really guidelines)
  - manipulate proportions to get different styles or "looks"
  - learn by heark: stick your proportions somewhere you see every day
- capture measurements for believability
  - based on head size
  - 8-head system as a typical height
1. head to chin
2. chin to nipple line
3. nipple line to navel line
4. navel line to crotch
5. (hips - to mid thigh)
6. mid thigh to bottom of knee
7. (to mid shin)
8. bottom of feet
- width: shoulder is 2.5-3.0 * head width
- arms: elbow at bottom of rib cage or slightly above navel line
- hands: halfway on the hips
- male: taller, female: shorter (7.0-7.5 heads)
- male: broad shoulders and narrow hips; female: narrow shoulders and broad hips
  - this isn't to be exact but is symbolic
  - this has to do with pelvis structure
  - great trochanter tends to be out further in females

## Proportions 2
- idealistic head proportions
- remember location of facial elements
0. circle with vertical centerline; divide horizontally into three parts
1. that second bottom-most line is the eye line
2. duplicate the 2/3 space above the eye line to below to find chin line
3. draw a chin shape pulling tangents from the circle down to chin line
4. indicate oval eyes around the eye line, placed in the middle of each half
    - this leaves one eye space between eyes
    - it also leaves 3/4 eye space on the side of each eye
5. the bottom of the circle becomes the nose bottom
6. divide space between bottom of nose and chin into three
    - top third is mouth line
7. indicate eyebrows half an eye or 3/4 eye height above the eyes
8. ears go bottom of nose to top of eyebrows
- these are "general hint proportions"
  - relatively normal characters
- circle first instead of ovular
  - we can create different jaw shapes
  - we can still use those rules to find face lines for stylized characters!

## Proportions 3
- head in side view
  - same measurements but turned
1. start with ovular cranium (extend horizontally)
2. put vertical centerline through shape
3. divide in three to find eyeline again
4. duplicate top two thirds down again to find chin
5. pull straight down from front of oval eyeline down to chinline
6. divide space from centerline to front into three vertically
7. place the eye along the frontmost division at the eyeline
8. bottom of cranium shapes are same Proportions: noseline
9. then divide subnose space into three, upper is mouth
10. find eyebrow
11. measure eyebrow line to bottom of noseline: ear height
12. place ear just behind centerline at slight angle
13. add the neck coming off back of oval and into back 2/3 front of centerline
- remember:
  - cranium is elliptical from side view
  - ear is behind the centerline
  - front of face space is divided into three in front of centerline

## Proportions 4
- proportions of hands are straightforward
1. draw a circle for the palm and divide sectionally horizontally and vertically
2. duplicate height upwards
3. draw middle finger
4. draw index and ring around as shorter but roughyl same relative to each other
5. pinky comes off ring but ends touching the horizontal line
6. draw titled circle in lower right quadrant of circle to show thumb muscle
7. draw out the thumb shape from that circle
8. start connecting from around that big scircle
- sum it up in three rules:
  - middle finger and palm have equal height
  - ring and index finger have equal height
  - thumb falls below halfway mark of the palm
- middle finger and palm height as calibrating the rest of the hand

## Dynamism in the Form
- static vs dynamic forms
- imagine a perfect sphere vs a bent ball of clay
  - the second form has directionality
  - shape of the form gives impression of movement
- same thing when taking a static cube
  - bend the sides to make it look like stretching
- cylinder
  - bend cylinder along sides and scale down bottom circle to show direction
- basic forms can be converted into dynamic, living forms

# 3. Character Forms and Proportions

## Introduction
- learning shorthand forms to get up to speed
- build your own character forms
- forms are here before shape?
  - the next module is about gesture
  - remember that implementation model? forms + shapes are at the same time
  - be like a sculptor and then infuse shape into what you formed realistically
  - shape as molding forms
- revisit these ideas often because drawing forms is basis for dynamism
- "dynamic forms" as the critical concept
- anatomy is not equal to character design
  - characters have anatomy
  - _but_ so much of anatomy is part of the detail section
  - it's really about making forms not getting detailed anatomy
- complex anatomy can be learned by rote
  - lots of observational studies

## Proportions 1
- ideal body proportions
  - size, spacing, location
  - it's a ruleset (really guidelines)
  - manipulate proportions to get different styles or "looks"
  - learn by heark: stick your proportions somewhere you see every day
- capture measurements for believability
  - based on head size
  - 8-head system as a typical height
1. head to chin
2. chin to nipple line
3. nipple line to navel line
4. navel line to crotch
5. (hips - to mid thigh)
6. mid thigh to bottom of knee
7. (to mid shin)
8. bottom of feet
- width: shoulder is 2.5-3.0 * head width
- arms: elbow at bottom of rib cage or slightly above navel line
- hands: halfway on the hips
- male: taller, female: shorter (7.0-7.5 heads)
- male: broad shoulders and narrow hips; female: narrow shoulders and broad hips
  - this isn't to be exact but is symbolic
  - this has to do with pelvis structure
  - great trochanter tends to be out further in females

## Proportions 2
- idealistic head proportions
- remember location of facial elements
0. circle with vertical centerline; divide horizontally into three parts
1. that second bottom-most line is the eye line
2. duplicate the 2/3 space above the eye line to below to find chin line
3. draw a chin shape pulling tangents from the circle down to chin line
4. indicate oval eyes around the eye line, placed in the middle of each half
    - this leaves one eye space between eyes
    - it also leaves 3/4 eye space on the side of each eye
5. the bottom of the circle becomes the nose bottom
6. divide space between bottom of nose and chin into three
    - top third is mouth line
7. indicate eyebrows half an eye or 3/4 eye height above the eyes
8. ears go bottom of nose to top of eyebrows
- these are "general hint proportions"
  - relatively normal characters
- circle first instead of ovular
  - we can create different jaw shapes
  - we can still use those rules to find face lines for stylized characters!

## Proportions 3
- head in side view
  - same measurements but turned
1. start with ovular cranium (extend horizontally)
2. put vertical centerline through shape
3. divide in three to find eyeline again
4. duplicate top two thirds down again to find chin
5. pull straight down from front of oval eyeline down to chinline
6. divide space from centerline to front into three vertically
7. place the eye along the frontmost division at the eyeline
8. bottom of cranium shapes are same Proportions: noseline
9. then divide subnose space into three, upper is mouth
10. find eyebrow
11. measure eyebrow line to bottom of noseline: ear height
12. place ear just behind centerline at slight angle
13. add the neck coming off back of oval and into back 2/3 front of centerline
- remember:
  - cranium is elliptical from side view
  - ear is behind the centerline
  - front of face space is divided into three in front of centerline

## Proportions 4
- proportions of hands are straightforward
1. draw a circle for the palm and divide sectionally horizontally and vertically
2. duplicate height upwards
3. draw middle finger
4. draw index and ring around as shorter but roughyl same relative to each other
5. pinky comes off ring but ends touching the horizontal line
6. draw titled circle in lower right quadrant of circle to show thumb muscle
7. draw out the thumb shape from that circle
8. start connecting from around that big scircle
- sum it up in three rules:
  - middle finger and palm have equal height
  - ring and index finger have equal height
  - thumb falls below halfway mark of the palm
- middle finger and palm height as calibrating the rest of the hand

## Dynamism in the Form
- static vs dynamic forms
- imagine a perfect sphere vs a bent ball of clay
  - the second form has directionality
  - shape of the form gives impression of movement
- same thing when taking a static cube
  - bend the sides to make it look like stretching
- cylinder
  - bend cylinder along sides and scale down bottom circle to show direction
- basic forms can be converted into dynamic, living forms

## Drawing the Head and Neck Forms
- head typically two shapes: sphere and triangular form and cylinder
  - cylinder as the neck
  - "triangular form" as two side triangles joined by square plane normal front
  - sphere as cranium
- directionality to the head
  - neck should be directional: smaller at top
  - drawing on rotation to see multiple sides instead of flat front of face
  - sphere and cylinder should imply bending to chin
  - do 3/4 rotations to see depth and dynamism
- feel out the forms as you draw, attaching them as appropriate
  - neck to base of cranium
  - neck will scale up to below chin to meet torso
- play with bending the forms and sizing them to get different shapes
  - bend back cylinder and head for new look
  - stack forms imagining like top and bottom view
  - small ellipse and big for neck, as well as triangle shape tapering for chin
- chin triangular block can be long or short for different looks
- make forms directional
  - mold triangle block so it comes off face and has directionality downwards
  - mold neck so that it's bigger and bends up to smaller for direction up
- later: reasons for directionality in living forms
- adding skin
  - overlay skin atop forms using what we know about overlaps
  - again, sphere, down to triangular block, then cylinder
  - drop in the eyeline while you're at it
  - add in proportional features for eyes, nose, mouth
  - get harder lines in place for skin placement
  - line weights and overlap atop neck
- working with good shape-form and adding directionality makes it believable
  - audience geared to see the 3D and life
- amateur flat and blocky forms will not read as believable
- strong forms with limited quick work, on the other hand, gives sense of detail
- remember module 2: _loose lines_ and _line weights_ matter here!

## Drawing the Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis Forms
- rudimentary shapes for getting torso right
  - chest starts with rectangular block
  - abdomen starts as sphere
    - allows for abdominal rotation as a "hinging point"
  - pelvis could be a basic upside-down triangle
- forms that allow adding head and neck
  - bend chest block for rounded side lines
  - add v-shape to bottom of chest block
  - now slide abdominal sphere into v plug
  - start triangular pyramid pelvis coming down from ellipse more like a bowl
  - bend triangular pyramid pelvis down from top of bowl to a point
  - draw ellipses on both sides of pointy bowl for plugging in legs
- mess around with rotations (we've been doing 3/4 view)
  - get side view of pelvis to see where leg plugs in even better
  - really play with pivoting and twisting forms from the abs
  - top of chest marks shoulder line
  - motion: shoulder line and pelvis line are not parallel
  - notice where centerlines point - they show where character faces and twists
  - change pelvis centerline to see twist: chest and pelvis face different ways
- skin on the forms
  - focus on being loose and not worrying so much about proportions
  - basic dynamic forms again for chest, abs, pelvis
  - make sure they have directionality
  - surface detail follows form of chest, then down to pelvis
  - then out around pelvis (no legs yet) and v groin at bottom of triangle
  - chest above ribcage v notch
  - anatomy adds little details for iliac crest and delts about shoulder
  - imagine cloth falling over forms
  - add head and shoulder plugs
  - ribcage v implies a v for the skin detail

## Drawing the Arms and Legs Forms
- use cylinder for limbs
  - use dynamism to show off movement of limbs
  - curves between larger and smaller ellipses
  - don't need anatomy, just bending basic forms
- opposing curves theory (talked about in module 4)
  - if one thing curves one way, the other cuves the other way
  - this as applying throughout anatomy (mentioned at end of next section)
- arms attach to points in chest block from torso
  - one cylinder each for the upper and one for the lower
  - bend each in different ways
  - then add hands to achieve different dynamics
- instructor doesn't add joint balls
  - apart from pelvis and sometimes knee
  - they encumber limbs drawn on top of them
  - instead draw ellipses then from there rest of cylinder
- arm measurements
  - lines from rib cage to end of upper cylinder
  - lower bent cylinder down to legs
- legs
  - start from pelvis
  - draw ellipse nearby but sticking out from pelvis
  - bend cylinders down to knee
  - use lowers to make a pose but use opposing curves
- apply dynamism to avoid static, non-living drawings
  - _really_ understand that blocky, non-dynamic forms don't read well
- arm and leg with skin
  - notice bigger ellipse is at the top
  - notice both have same basic two-cylinder forms
  - add skin lines around cylinders
  - add basic skin connecting a knee with a v
  - add basic skin connection an elbow v
- indicate hands
  - right now indicate them with ellipses beyond the second dynamic cylinder

## Drawing the Hands Forms
- standard poses with hands are not too difficult
  - can be figured out without reference
- basic forms
  - palm with a block
  - fingers with a cylinder
  - make these dynamic (you know by now... bend them!)
- form palms
  - smaller plane at bottom, larger at top
  - connect with bent side lines
  - mark circle for thumb and circles for fingers
- form fingers
  - three cylinders each with opposing curves to last
  - three parts but 1-3 can be used depending (such as thumb)
- use proportions for middle finger and thumb placement from before
- demonstration
  - do a 3/4 hand structure to see front and side
  - mark fingers and sphere for thumb
  - line jutting fingers out perpendicular from palm maybe bending a little back
  - from there the other two opposing curves come out of each finger
  - the second cylinder opposes a bit forward
  - make sure to account for each cylinder's length to add up to total finger
  - thumb comes out (one cylinder) then ends in opposing second cylinder
- palm poses
  - consider how palm block bends depending on the pose
  - side of the palm should clearly bend
- add skin
  - use your own hands as reference
  - follow the form lines even when they lead into the palm (like thumb)
  - basic skin layer connecting cylinders
- why use these forms
  - muscles and skin layers are hard to rotate in space
  - dealing with simple curved cylinders and a bent block are much easier
  - these forms make imagining other sides so much easier, too
  - the details can change (like front to back)
- indicating hands in bigger drawings
  - indicate instead of getting all the forms down during a drawing
  - draw in the form for the palm
  - then just indicate dynamic lines for the fingers (bending the fingers)
  - lines should show directionality and should have the right proportions
  - this way you can come back to add forms later
- focusing on finger bend
  - follow the curves and place cylinders to articulate along the finger
  - opposing curves rule is crucial
  - think of how finger is bending and interacting
  - notice how final cylinder turns when finger presses a solid surface

## Drawing the Feet Forms
- feet have pyramid block type shape
- side view looks triangular, with larger front and less in back
- front tip represents individual toes has split point
- heel connector as split point
- drawn through, bottom is square plane, top is blocky
- splits
  - front split for toes
  - second front split behind that for front of foot
  - large rest of first forward half for arc of foot
  - heel as everything behind (smaller volume)
- add opposing curves for dynamism
  - arc front of foot down
  - heel has opposing kind of up
  - toes bend up opposing the arc
  - with more detail, first toe curve is up, toes actually then curve in/down
  - toeline: curve from small toes to big instead of straight across
  - mark out the toes
  - treat heel as section apart from arc
    - curve the back for the heel
    - curve the bottom of the foot for the arch
- the curves add "overskin layer"
- note top/bottom view has outer and inner curves
  - opposing curves still: out for big toe, in beside big toe, out ball, in arch, out heel
  - note the long curve on the outsidebelow the small toe
- from here attach the leg

## Drawing the Breast Forms
- no bone structure here, instead soft
- spherical type of shape but taper top for egg-like shape
- draw chest with notch again
  - put down center line
  - notch at top for clavicle joining collar bone
- flatten out then curve low chest
- imagine water balloons pushed against a hard surface
- use notch on top for positioning
  - draw shapes from notch, going away from midline
  - draw down to bottom of water balloons
  - that's just a guide though not the detail or muscle
  - musculature is different and actually tucks under deltoid/shoulder
  - far side breast shows "flattening" in 3/4 view
- heuristics
  - upside down heart below out of that clavicle notch
  - malleable water balloons against surface and impacted by gravity

## Putting the Forms Together
- drawing front and back of male and female bodies, then adding skin layers
- male
  - start with male head form
  - down to chest, imagining heads proportionally down body
  - add neck (put chest before neck)
  - down to ab ball
  - then pelvis
  - over to arms, very loose, bendy cylinders
  - no need for small spherical joints to know joint is present
  - legs, but of course much larger than limbs
  - keep proportional head count down legs
  - the triangular feet
  - circular hand indications
  - center lines down the middle of forms to connect things
- male back view
  - different perspective, same process
  - imagine tilt and the back view of torso
  - make sure to use cylinders and opposing curves
- female
  - expect shorter shoulder and wider hips compared to version
  - chest
  - ab, and at this point add centerline guides
  - pelvis "cup"
  - hips out
  - simple forms with Dynamism
  - legs down to feet
  - then add in arms and simple hands
  - check curves, add breasts
- female back view
  - same forms and theory
  - remember to try drawing fast since construction is messy
  - make sure shoulders aren't too broad
  - check scaling to make sure proportions are right
- return to male front and back
  - lightly erase or turn down opacity on construction
  - add skin layer guided by lines
  - knee bump and crotch section
  - not every line needs connected
  - just indicate the hands
  - following the forms can yield effective skin layer
  - v buttocks
- return to female front and back
  - this is basic and rough but important
  - later you can study more advanced anatomy
  - keep learning anatomy, since it's an advantage
  - follow the forms for skin layer
- this shouldn't be detailed and should all be achievable at this point

## Drawing the Eyes
- eyeball form as sphere
- side view shows concave iris in front and lens on top of that
- pupil, places in back collecting light and color, cup shape, connector for brain
- put iris and pupil on top and then be able to rotate
  - sphere, then iris and pupil as 3 concentric circles
  - add a bit of lens when rotating
  - rotate it: another spehere, contour lines, then ellipse on the side
    - this is rotating the eye form, not just the eye in its socket
  - remember lens is convex so pupil moves slightly in
  - do the same rotating the opposite way horizontally
- specular highlight
  - show how lens works and light bounces off eye
  - little highlight indication near pupil
- get used to doing the spherical eyes before building up
- eyelid
  - start with rotated eye, slightly elliptical iris and pupil, highlight
  - lids wrap around eyeball
  - form: start with basic lines going from contour edges around the eye
    - imagine thick volumes around eye, so structure has bands and extra lines
    - these hold eye into the socket
    - upper and lower thickness not always visible, but whichever is is wet
    - upper eyelid has indented curve before hitting browline
- do some rough drawings at this point to get eyes and wrapped eyelids down
  - practice adding thick eyelid curves and sketching their mass
  - practice eyes looking in different directions from different angles
- eyelashes and eye details are... well, just details for later
- simple tips
  - heuristic: concave in the iris, convex in the lens
  - typically draw from a rotation, often 3/4
  - draw in the spheres in the right location
  - make the eyelid heights the same but differentiate their curves
    - the far eye has a sharp, almost right-angle eyelid curve
    - the near eye has a gentle eyelid curve
    - opposing curves: left side of near eye is an opposing diamond-shape curve
    - that curve comes from inner tear duct, opposing until down that gentle slope
    - the bottom eyelid is similar mirrored, making rounded diamond pattern
  - the rotation often makes far eye go into that single right-angle curve instead
    - then the bottom of that eye shape does the two opposing curves
  - near eye ends up wider than far eye in 3/4 rotation
  - corners should point to each other
  - always leave a space between far side eye and headline
    - some draw up to or even over that side line
    - remember to leave that proportional space
  - upper lid lines crease, but lower lines aren't as creased
    - draw in lines to show volume of upper lids
- eye placement on basic head form
  - place spheres at eyeline
  - use shorthand and tips to draw upper eyelids
  - save other lines until you're ready
  - when you are ready, come back to the indications and fill out eyes

## Drawing the Ears
- like very squished cylinder on its side with large and med elliptical ends
- take a cross section diagonally along the cylinder, cut the larger piece off
- now rotate this so it protrudes with upper end out
- don't draw thin flappy ears hanging off the side of a line
- instead suggest the skin not seen behind and the front opening
  - form coming out of head not just loose skin hanging off
  - the structure inside of ear is added to this basic form
- variation: more or less rounded, lobes that connect or don't
- interior ear lines
  - draw outer curve
  - draw inner arc paralleling top of outer curve
  - draw small horizontal line from medial part of that arc
  - draw an upside-down bottle shape starting above the line that comes back up
  - have the bottle shape end in a Q well before meeting the inner arc
  - pull another line down out of the end of the inner arc
  - indicate two diagonal lines between inner arc and bottle
- 3/4 view of ear
  - tilt same speaker/cylinder shape out a little
  - remember that ear tilts back
  - now you need to overlap the top part of inner arc over its back part
  - draw that small line, then the bottle, then interior flap Q
  - then the other lines and you're good to go

## Drawing the Nose
- pyramidal structure with flat plane front, square plane bottom
- smaller on-their-side pyramidals going from bottom front to each side
- bend these forms and add curves to start seeing shape
  - bending nostril triangular side shapes you really start to see a nose
- tricks: straight on view
  - horizontal squished ellipse for straight on
  - add the bottom of nostrils at angles from bottom of nose
  - now you can simply add round sides of nostrils implying bottom and bridge
  - this is often good enough to suggest whole nose
  - with bridge you can imply side planes
- tricks: 3/4 view
  - tilted ellipse for 3/4 view
  - draw near nostril with slight downward tilt
  - round out bottom of nose
  - one style has "pixie" nose curving back from the bottom point
  - optionally add one more line for side curve of nostril
  - "sticking out" nose bends up into bridge instead of pointing
- from here you can change proportions and forms for different noses
  - emphasize bottom of nose shape and nostrils
  - manga style with more of a bump rather than bottom curve and top curve

## Drawing the Mouth and Lips
- lots of anatomy
- skull above top teeth is very curved (the top jaw)
- bottom jaw also curved
  - connection from side near ears
  - cylindrical (half cylinder) for bottom
- so the mouth should be built atop cylindrical form
  - while drawing mouths know what's beneath the face
  - it's "very, very round"
- construction of mouth
  - place mouth on mouthline from basic head before
  - draw curved line
  - 3/4 angle shows rounded mouth and downward curves at sides
- lips as five cylinders
  - top lip: two angled on sides, one squished in mid
  - bottom lip: two angled cylinders
- adding dynamism to lips
  - bend cylinders for thin sides and thicker mids
  - don't forget mid point
  - opposing curves implies bottom bow
- skin: follow forms around, top mid bump
- indicate the teeth often with curved line
- tricks or techniques
  - usually no need to draw in every lip line
  - often draw in mouth and hint at bottom lip shadow
  - sometimes hint at top lip indent
- the underlying forms impact indentations in lips
- hinting along with gloss/highlights
- add mouth corners for believability
- though lips blend into other skin some styles require lines
- bottom line of top lip is darkest line

## Demo of Facial features
- again, be messy and loose
- do face, jaw, neck
- find lines and ear height
- shape out eyes, eyebrows, nose as learned
- draw iris with looking direction
- add a mouth line and lip anatomy
- construct ear and play with ear height
- leave hair off for now
- rough in ear parts, the ear anatomy trick
- flip image to keep checking if things escape you
- fix eye size and line up bottom eye lines
  - keep the proportions right
- cheek shape and position
- neck shape and position
- fill out ellipse for bottom nose plane
- at this point the rough should be close to done
- hair and details like clothing are added later
- traditional: rough, lightbox for refined, maybe one more iteration
- now do your skin and lines
  - get clean lines around structure
  - keep lines simple and few
  - adjust and refine while drawing over
  - indicate lashes if you want (instructor does 3)
  - imply lower inside shape of eye and imply bottom of iris
  - eye highlight
  - nose, nostril, side curve
  - top lip line, mouth corners, bottom of mouth
  - imply teeth, darken mouth if needed, bottom lip shadow

# 1. Intro to Art Fundamentals

## Basic Structure of Art
- shape
	- 2D or iconographic
	- shapes are flat on a page
	- use words like "circle"
	- 3D things have shape that viewer can see
		- the shape ignores these sides
- form
	- 3D or multiple sides
	- you can view object from angles
	- use words like "sphere"
	- has more to it
	- form theory includes "perspective" and "lighting"
- detail
	- material types and textures
	- color
- as a pyramid from bottom: shape, form, detail
	- shape takes up more volume than form, form more than detail
	- this represents the importance of each in your art

## Breaking Down the Structure
- see art in different ways
- shape: composition, iconographic shapes, dynamism, silhouette, read of shapes
- form: perspective, light, drawing from different sides in space
- detail: smaller details and color
- art theory
	- theoretical hierarchy: shape, form, detail
	- implementation theory: form & shape, detail
		- this is the practical approach
		- draw the forms thinking of shape at the same time
		- shape informs the silhouettes of our forms
		- focus on form/shape over details (especially as beginner)
	- viewer's perspective: forms, details
		- average viewer is not looking at shape composition
		- it's more mixed in a way though
- this explains why beginners struggle
	- they try to draw a form and fill in some details
	- they're seen as kind of 50/50 in importance
	- how we see is not how we make

## See like an Artist
- start by looking at shapes
- ignore the details
- like finding the basic lines in a photo
	- seeing it "in a flat way"
- forms look for what's underlying
	- imagine the back sides of objects
	- what are the different planes?
	- imagine the mass and volume
- details look for colors and fine textures
	- our last concern
- observe and study to break things down this way

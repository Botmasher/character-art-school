# 1. Intro to Art Fundamentals

## Basic Structure of Art
- shape
	- 2D or iconographic
	- shapes are flat on a page
	- use words like "circle"
	- 3D things have shape that viewer can see
		- the shape ignores these sides
- form
	- 3D or multiple sides
	- you can view object from angles
	- use words like "sphere"
	- has more to it
	- form theory includes "perspective" and "lighting"
- detail
	- material types and textures
	- color
- as a pyramid from bottom: shape, form, detail
	- shape takes up more volume than form, form more than detail
	- this represents the importance of each in your art

## Breaking Down the Structure
- see art in different ways
- shape: composition, iconographic shapes, dynamism, silhouette, read of shapes
- form: perspective, light, drawing from different sides in space
- detail: smaller details and color
- art theory
	- theoretical hierarchy: shape, form, detail
	- implementation theory: form & shape, detail
		- this is the practical approach
		- draw the forms thinking of shape at the same time
		- shape informs the silhouettes of our forms
		- focus on form/shape over details (especially as beginner)
	- viewer's perspective: forms, details
		- average viewer is not looking at shape composition
		- it's more mixed in a way though
- this explains why beginners struggle
	- they try to draw a form and fill in some details
	- they're seen as kind of 50/50 in importance
	- how we see is not how we make

## See like an Artist
- start by looking at shapes
- ignore the details
- like finding the basic lines in a photo
	- seeing it "in a flat way"
- forms look for what's underlying
	- imagine the back sides of objects
	- what are the different planes?
	- imagine the mass and volume
- details look for colors and fine textures
	- our last concern
- observe and study to break things down this way

## Skill vs Emotion
- piece that is technical will not win over piece that has emotional impact
- viewers may be blind to technicalities if emotive
- understand that these aspects are "weighty"
- "story, feeling and emotion"
- relates to believability and realism

## Story
- vision: conception of who the character is
	- where do they live?
	- what's their personality?
	- what's the mood?
- again, emotional impact is key
- appeal: give people emotion and effectively communicate piece to viewer
- super important: artwork is the medium
	- create something cool, don't aim to make cool art
- focus on the concept and the vision not the medium
- could for example use words in book to create your same character
	- "do justice to" your concept
	- "story is everything" in character art

## Believability and Realism
- draw for appeal
- which matters more, believability or realism?
	- this goes back to technical skills vs emotion
	- remember that to make things meaningful believability wins
- don't get bogged down by how realistic something looks

## Maturity as an Artist
- a few points to focus on in your journey
	1. be selfish: focus on your own work, not the works of others, impress yourself
	2. fear: work through it and be brave (consider _Art and Fear_)
	3. fear of failure: be willing to fail in order to learn valuable things
	4. fear of technical ability: learn and exercise using repetition
- art is a medium so treat it as a technical process
- character drawing is not abstract, so realist, therefore rules apply

## Art Studies vs Art Creation
- art studies: learn and observe using visual notes and exercises
	- who cares what it looks like
	- observe and take notes
	- mostly for yourself
- art creation: make the main artwork
	- appeal and a good story
	- mostly for viewers
- these connect to fear
	- be fearless when making art

## Imaginative Art
- observational vs imaginative
	- observe and recreate, maybe with twists, from a reference
	- create straight out of your head and get it onto the page
- imaginative art requires firm understanding of theory
	- this is great for character art
	- this is the actual art created in this course
- observational art is a study tool for clothes, hair style, ...
- artists mix both

## Module 1 Summary
- shape, form, detail
	- triangles differ between artist thinking, implementing and viewer seeing
	- shape as a "hidden reason why" a piece feels good
- technical skill vs emotional impact
- story is everything
	- linked to emotional
- focus on believability over realism
- study vs creation
- imaginative vs observational
	- observational easier and straightforward, often people on the street art
	- imaginative realism as normal for character design

## Module 1 Assignments
- draw a character (used as gauge when draw same character at end of course)

## 4. Gesture Drawing Foundations

## What is Gesture?
- not always life drawings from photos or models
- attempt to capture the core of a figure in a pose
- use understanding of gesture to give characters life
- directional flow or "shape gestures" to create readable silhouettes
  - these are flat shapes but have movement
- dynamic form gestures takedirectional flow and add form on top
  - same structures we built in the previous module
  - get the movement into the forms from the directional flow
- anatomical gestures then build anatomy from reference material
  - use reference to get believable anatomical forms on top
- life gesture drawing
  - after understanding shape, form, anatomy
  - look at people and capture their gestures as fast as possible
  - these are like scribbles but intend to convey real gestures
- so we learn in this order:
  1. shape gestures
  2. form gestures
  3. anatomical gestures
  4. life gestures
- use gesture to communicate who are characters are and how they act
- exaggerate basic gestures
  - if you do not "push the pose" your cleanup stage dulls the gestures
  - adding detail like clothing tends to tone down the character's gesture

## Gesture's Core Foundation
- remember to bend sides to give directionality
- avoid static forms
  - imagine a static cube viewed from an angle (this is not directional)
  - we want forms with bends and curves that pull the viewer directionally
- use _opposing curves_ to apply dynamism to the human form
  - one curve curves, then the next curve flips along the same direction
  - don't repeat curves because it pauses the flow
  - don't oppose curves in parallel lines since it stops the directionality
- "straight to curve" and "curve against straight" as similar
  - these aren't about gesture though
  - these are about avoiding certain shapes
- try taking a photo and drawing the curves to see how opposing curves work
  - start with the head
  - the back of the head is a convex curve, then the neck concaves
  - the back goes out and down, the pelvis down and out
  - and so on for limbs
  - hands follow opposing curves once you get to that level of detail
  - for arms try reading the forearm movement first before adding upper arm
  - take the photo away and you're left with gestural shapes!
  - now add cylinders and forms to fill out some construction
- note that you're not capturing anatomy, it's about directional forms
  - gestural anatomy is different from directional gesture
  - how believable is the movement you captured?
- this is about theory not adding a workflow
  - remember shape and form are the same step for us
  - you can do this to understand or modify your own workflow though
- apply opposing curves for immediate results that feel natural, informed, believable

## Action in the Form
- _primary line of action_ in characters
  - primary line of action: summary of the overall movement of the pose
  - primary line tends to be a C-curve or S-curve
  - primary line is a gestural line not an existing centerline
  - primary line isn't particularly directional
- _secondary line of action_ in characters
  - secondary lines flow from the primary line unless something is out of whack
  - secondary lines come out of the main line and may flow alongside it
  - secondary lines may summarize movement in limbs and the head
  - secondary lines are often S-curves or opposing curves but can simplify to C

## Lines of Importance
- _Line of Action_ is the primary line from the last bit on movement in the pose
- _Spinal Line_ suggests the silhouette of the torso and defines the curve of the back
- _Center Line_ runs axially through the forms and helps measure for feature placement
  - helps place not only things like facial features but also patterns or buttons on clothing

## Axis of the Form
- horizontal tilt axes
  - use eyeline to determine horizontal head tilt
  - use shoulders for upper body tilt
  - use pelvis for pelvic tilt
  - use knees for leg tilt
- vertical tilts
  - basically centerlines through the head, torso, pelvis, two legs
- avoid having any parallels to make sure your characters are dynamic!
- consider examples with and without parallels
  - draw construction for a figure that's "tiltless"
  - now use a selection tool to tilt each of the above
- "contraposto" or "counterpose" as example
  - this even shows small squash-and-stretch on the sides of the torso
- avoid tiltless art unless you mean for something to look "blueprinty"

## Basic Gesture Drawing
- start with the head
- establish the primary line of action
- then build on the line to find tilts
  - the eyeline, shoulderline, pelvic line
  - the knee line if you can find it (some poses make this harder)
- get the shapes in, focusing on gestural flow not anatomical drawing
  - forearm then upper arm
  - simply indicate hands
  - indicate the neck
  - now get lines around the chest and abdomen
  - get the pelvis in
  - draw the directional shapes for the upper and lower legs
  - simply indicate the feet
- scale may be off but anyone should be able to read the gesture from your sketch
- get to the point where you can do this in 60 secs for a figure
  - this should be quick and messy but readable and replicable

## Dynamic Form Gestures
- start with shape then move to form if you're having trouble
- once the head, line of action and tilt are in move to forms
  - head with circular then jaw
  - chest with notch and ball abdomen
  - pelvis like pyramidal bowl again
  - the leg cylinders for both legs
  - the triangle block feet with no more detail than that
  - the forearm and upper arm cylinders for both arms
  - indicate the hands
  - work out any curvature issues but keep it rough
- again, this isn't for the anatomy it's for the dynamism
  - you're supposed to feel out the figure's forms
  - so many of the instructor's students worry about mistakes at this stage

## Advanced Gesture Drawing
- work from your reference but merely as a guide
- reference eample of a dancer/stretcher
- get the head, line of action, eyeline, shoulder line, pelvic line in
- start adding shape and form to upper body
- down to the legs getting the forms in
- stay quick to avoid the stiffness trap of slow drawing
- use contour shapes when something really sticks out and makes it believable
  - the calf and the squash/stretch along the sides of the torso
- skin following the abs and into arms
- collarbone and breast positions
- now lightly erase this and go back over really getting reference motion in
  - still stay very fast and loose
  - make curves dramatic (don't sacrifice drama)
  - exaggerate the forms
  - merely indicate anatomy in knees, prominent muscles and shapes
  - basic shapes for clothing
- now go to refined layer and get the lines in
  - no longer working much from reference
  - get lines and line weights that capture and enhance the gesture
  - avoid too much detail on hands and feet
  - keep lines directional
  - enhance key overlaps
  - indicate anatomical lines for effect: ribcage, overall hand shape
- we are not recreating references but stealing from life to capture gestures
- instructor compares the final to a more detailed sketch
  - this has the right silhouette and more details like face, hair
  - but it captures the outline of the image more than it does the movement
  - do _not_ copy the contours of the reference piece
- make sure you capture the pose, forms, motion, gesture rather than details

## Life Gestures
- capture the overall gesture/pose of someone in real life
- this goes so quickly it's really mainly about capturing the gestural shape
- grab the dynamism very quickly from their forms
- capturing life forms
  - keep it sketchy and very messy
  - get the directional flow
  - tempted to spend more time but keep it very fast
- later take these and go over them to actually do a character
- simplify angles
- a few interesting detail hints that will serve as reminders or captures
  - what people are holding, sitting on, wearing or their hair
  - it's not about the details

## How to: Gesture Exercises
- image viewer on one side, art program on the other
- use the "Gesture Studies Template" from Module 4
  - 20 per sheet
  - if using traditional page instead do about four per page
- draw on the right based on timing assigment (60s, 120s, ...)
- From here move to the assigments
  - dynamic shape, dynamic form, anatomical & life gestures
  - 20 of each with time limit

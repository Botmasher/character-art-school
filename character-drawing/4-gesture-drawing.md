## 4. Gesture Drawing Foundations

## What is Gesture?
- not always life drawings from photos or models
- attempt to capture the core of a figure in a pose
- use understanding of gesture to give characters life
- directional flow or "shape gestures" to create readable silhouettes
  - these are flat shapes but have movement
- dynamic form gestures takedirectional flow and add form on top
  - same structures we built in the previous module
  - get the movement into the forms from the directional flow
- anatomical gestures then build anatomy from reference material
  - use reference to get believable anatomical forms on top
- life gesture drawing
  - after understanding shape, form, anatomy
  - look at people and capture their gestures as fast as possible
  - these are like scribbles but intend to convey real gestures
- so we learn in this order:
  1. shape gestures
  2. form gestures
  3. anatomical gestures
  4. life gestures
- use gesture to communicate who are characters are and how they act
- exaggerate basic gestures
  - if you do not "push the pose" your cleanup stage dulls the gestures
  - adding detail like clothing tends to tone down the character's gesture

## Gesture's Core Foundation
- remember to bend sides to give directionality
- avoid static forms
  - imagine a static cube viewed from an angle (this is not directional)
  - we want forms with bends and curves that pull the viewer directionally
- use _opposing curves_ to apply dynamism to the human form
  - one curve curves, then the next curve flips along the same direction
  - don't repeat curves because it pauses the flow
  - don't oppose curves in parallel lines since it stops the directionality
- "straight to curve" and "curve against straight" as similar
  - these aren't about gesture though
  - these are about avoiding certain shapes
- try taking a photo and drawing the curves to see how opposing curves work
  - start with the head
  - the back of the head is a convex curve, then the neck concaves
  - the back goes out and down, the pelvis down and out
  - and so on for limbs
  - hands follow opposing curves once you get to that level of detail
  - for arms try reading the forearm movement first before adding upper arm
  - take the photo away and you're left with gestural shapes!
  - now add cylinders and forms to fill out some construction
- note that you're not capturing anatomy, it's about directional forms
  - gestural anatomy is different from directional gesture
  - how believable is the movement you captured?
- this is about theory not adding a workflow
  - remember shape and form are the same step for us
  - you can do this to understand or modify your own workflow though
- apply opposing curves for immediate results that feel natural, informed, believable

## Action in the Form
- _primary line of action_ in characters
  - primary line of action: summary of the overall movement of the pose
  - primary line tends to be a C-curve or S-curve
  - primary line is a gestural line not an existing centerline
  - primary line isn't particularly directional
- _secondary line of action_ in characters
  - secondary lines flow from the primary line unless something is out of whack
  - secondary lines come out of the main line and may flow alongside it
  - secondary lines may summarize movement in limbs and the head
  - secondary lines are often S-curves or opposing curves but can simplify to C

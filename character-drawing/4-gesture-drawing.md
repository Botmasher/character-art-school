## 4. Gesture Drawing Foundations

## What is Gesture?
- not always life drawings from photos or models
- attempt to capture the core of a figure in a pose
- use understanding of gesture to give characters life
- directional flow or "shape gestures" to create readable silhouettes
  - these are flat shapes but have movement
- dynamic form gestures takedirectional flow and add form on top
  - same structures we built in the previous module
  - get the movement into the forms from the directional flow
- anatomical gestures then build anatomy from reference material
  - use reference to get believable anatomical forms on top
- life gesture drawing
  - after understanding shape, form, anatomy
  - look at people and capture their gestures as fast as possible
  - these are like scribbles but intend to convey real gestures
- so we learn in this order:
  1. shape gestures
  2. form gestures
  3. anatomical gestures
  4. life gestures
- use gesture to communicate who are characters are and how they act
- exaggerate basic gestures
  - if you do not "push the pose" your cleanup stage dulls the gestures
  - adding detail like clothing tends to tone down the character's gesture

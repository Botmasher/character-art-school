# 2. Drawing Fundamentals

## Warmup and Penmanship
- do not draw slowly
- timing: about 5 minutes of exercises before actual drawing
- grade your exercises with check marks or xouts next to them
- first exercise: draw pages of circles
  - fast and loose - circles don't close
  - lock your wrist and draw with your arm
  - consider drawing circles inside the circles
- second exercise: draw ellipses (circle rotated in perspective)
  - if cut along minor axis could the two sides match?
  - minor axis points to vanishing point in perspective
  - vary the degree of rotation to end up with thicker/thinner looking shapes
- third exercise: draw straight lines
  - keep them parallel
  - fast and loose with locked wrist again
  - three pages of these
- fourth exercise: join points
  - try to get as straight a line as possible
  - rotate the page as needed
  - use your good line (instructor has good lines from bottom to top)

## Drawing in 3D
- draw through forms
- as realists things should look believable in the real world
- viewers can see multiple sides of objects
  - cube up high with front, side, bottom
  - add extra line around any shape and it looks like it has a side to it
  - similarly, drawing line on craggly shape makes it look like a rock
  - these lines suggest added planes to bring viewer into a 3D world
- instead of adding though you should be "drawing through forms"
  - everything real has form to it
  - imagine other sides and feel out the structure of the object
  - draw contour lines on spheres in construction phase
  - cylinders have outer ellipses that can add convincing outer edges
- "think sculpturally" and push your mind with practice
  - imagine the planes and sides of objects
  - this then lets you imagine rotating objects on the page
  - rarely do you want a direct face-on view, you want some rotation
    - straight-on side view of a cylinder is shaped like a rectangle
    - but consider the different shapes you get when rotating cylinder
  - connect all the sides together
- complex forms
  - anatomy and human form involve simpler shapes put together
  - basic boxes, cylinders and triangular forms
  - you may do things like bend cylinders or squash spheres
  - structural workflow still builds up shape -> forms -> detail
- so draw through and imagine volume and mass!

## Dynamic Drawing
- looseness and dynamism
- looseness is physical
  - slow lines are less straight and have less directionality
  - loose lines look smooth and taper on the ends
  - slow curved lines look disrupted and less flowing
  - draw with your arm for bigger shapes, wrist for small shapes
  - do not do small, fast, scratchy lines
  - do not do long, slow lines
  - loose strokes look professional
- dynamism is movement and shape flow
  - opposite of static
  - give shapes a flow by moving in a "definitive direction"
  - in real motion and perspective characters aren't symmetrical
  - bend forms to bring life into shapes
  - bring motion to viewers especially with life
- smooth, dynamic lines are more interesting to viewer

## Showing Depth
- tangents
  - two objects touch each other (their lines)
  - it's unclear where they separate
  - overlap lines to show which objects are in front of others
- overlaps are better than tangents
  - tangents result in flatness that causes uncertainty
- knee lines are one example
- simple shapes overlapping help viewer distinguish
- make this explicit: do I have any tangents?

## Asymmetry
- parallels
  - parallel lines (literal)
  - parallel objects (mirroring)
  - parallel counts (symbolic)
- parallels "feel too balanced"
  - break them up
  - if you have two mountains equally spaced apart
- avoid them at all times
  - even if it means doing odd numbers of buttons on shirt
- ask: does this feel too engineered? would asymmetry improve it?

## Communicating with Lines
- line weights
- atmospheric perspective
  - imagine a close vs far object
  - further object is lighter
  - air buildup between objects
  - more air with more distance
  - so air lightens values with distance
- line weighting enhances overlaps
  - introduce atmospheric perspective
  - "thicker lines come forward"
  - "thinner lines recede"
  - weight the front overlaps and even darken the back lines coming out of overlap
- make inner details thinner and lighter
  - muscular details, shirt creases
- make overlaps darker
  - heads, shoulders when objects slung behind them
  - emphasize hands and arms holding things when overlap with body
- background objects will have lighter lines even for their silhouette
  - consider what is your focal point
- stack your theory:
  - forms -> overlaps -> line weights
  - consciously check your pieces as you go along

## Planning Lines Ahead
- thinly and lightly
- rather than heavy lines, don't press hard and draw lighter lines
  - provides more contrast
  - very useful for rough sketch
  - helps control line weights
  - allows for corrections
- avoid erasing dark lines to thin them out
- modify construction and, again, control line weights
- when ignored to the extreme, you end up with hectic, dark drawings

## Speed Drawing
- beginners often hesitate to draw quickly
- draw fast
  - again, be loose (speedy translates to loose which translates to natural)
  - be accurate in the way the shapes read but not in the little details
- major asset: you can do more drawings
  - progress faster
  - save corrections for refinement
- pay attention to your goals (drawing fast is a major component)

## Two Stage Drawing Workflow
- workflow: order and steps to get work done
- two stages: the rough (part 1) and the refined (part 2)
- rough drawing
  - make solid foundations
  - implement theory
  - plan or blueprint
  - carefree but kind of ugly
  - check off boxes, don't make it pretty (construction site)
- refined drawing
  - neat and clean (including clean lines), with a focus on presentation
  - this is where you make it pretty
  - remember this is secondary to the rough
  - still a very creative stage
    - "the most creative"
    - since rough was structural, now you get to do the "decorating"
  - try out new lines and colors
- build the fun, creative refined on structural, theory-implementing rough
- theory is in the rough but refined takes longer (80/20)
- shape-form-detail triangle "implies a workflow"
  - shape and form and detail, then a refinement
  - as a beginner, rough stage includes shape-form-detail
  - refined stage has its own theory but nothing as heavy as rough
- this course will focus on the rough
  - it's easier to finish up a strong foundation than fix a bad one

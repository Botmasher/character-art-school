# 7. Facial Expression and Emotion

## Dynamics of the Face
- three crucial areas to focus on
  - the eyebrows
  - the eyes and upper eyelids
  - the mouth and lips
- those areas can be used for a variety of expressions
- note that skin movements also happen across the face during expressions
  - pay attention to compression like wrinkles in forehead, closed eyes
  - changes to the bottom eyeline are important to notice
  - the face uses a lot of squash and stretch
- mechanical movement areas
  - upper eyelid has a range of movement over the eye
  - the lower lid doesn't move much unless the cheek compresses
  - the lower jaw has a range of movement that the upper jaw does not
- apply squash and stretch to mechanical movement
  - like the cheeks as the lower jaw moves
- avoid basic expressions
  - basic expressions include sad, happy, angry, neutral
  - instead go with complex emotions
  - how is the character really feeling?
- humans are good at reading emotions
  - this implies that small changes will read
  - subtle changes can create very different expressions

## Keys to Expressing with the Eyes
- three things we can control to make an impact
- squinting (me: I think this is more crossing)
  - cartoon eyes are often drawn with sphere, iris, pupil
  - slightly moving iris and pupil inwards makes eyes look focused
  - the ones that are center aligned look a little zoned out
  - this is slight though
- dilation
  - big pupils vs small pupils
  - big pupils: not much light but also cute or goofy
  - small pupils: very bright but also interest, analysis, shock
- eyelid coverage
  - this is the eyelid over the iris and pupil
  - fully visible iris: the character looks shocked or in a trance
  - partly covered iris: the pupil is still exposed but reads as neutral
  - half-covered iris: large, flatter lid, reading as tired or sultry
  - full coverage of eye: depends on context

## Keys to Expressing with the Eyebrows
- they have a "head" (near midline) and a "tail" (laterally)
- high: outward c-curve, mid: straight c-curve, concave c-curve
- eyebrow thickness
  - thicker can imply male or young (including "young girl characters")
  - thin can imply female or older
- try different eyebrows on faces
  - low serious or angry
  - neutral a bit above eyes
  - high outward for optimistic or surprised
  - bend low for sad
  - one down one up for quizzical, maybe arrogant
  - angry down tail-to-head for very upset
  - lower straight for focused
  - upwards slanted tail-to-head for very quizzical

## Keys to Expressing with the Mouth
- remember that the mouth is wrapping around, not a flat line
- focus above all on the lower line of the upper lip
  - a couple lines above and below this and the lip can read quickly
  - indicate the lip anatomy with two lines medially on the upper lip
  - the upper lip casts a bit of a shadow
- corners are key for expressing
  - shade or dot them to see expressions when corners pull up/down/neutral
- keys to mouth expression:
  - nice, dark upper lips lower line
  - corners of the mouth imply and even strongly change the expression
  - jaw movement
  - cheek movement
- jaw movement
  - understand where the jaw line is
  - jaw line should significantly drop when mouth expressions are large
  - skin should stretch when jaw line drops
- normal lip opening positions
  - slightly open with line curving around as normal position
  - more open with top line still in place but lower lip curving more down
  - me: you can see upper teeth and into the mouth
- circular lip opening positions (whistle, kiss)
  - the upper lip becomes triangular while the bottom rounds
  - kissing shape has both more circular and a smaller circle shape
  - me: you can see both upper and lower teeth
- wide lip opening positions (singing, laughing, yelling)
  - stretch the top and lower lips wide with the triangular upper and circular lower
  - singing has a very round shape with more teeth anatomy, tongue, uvula
  - gritting the teeth moves lips in bone shape and lots of teeth
- remember that the upper lip line should overlap the lower lip line
- cheek movement
  - as smiles widen and open, the cheeks compress
  - fake smiles do not involve eyes, instead compress the lower eyelid
  - lines around nose also show cheek muscle compressing (depending on style)
  - without these lines the smile looks fake to many viewers

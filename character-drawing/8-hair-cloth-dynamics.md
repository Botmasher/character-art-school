# 8. Hair and Cloth Dynamics

## Fundamentals of Drawing Hair
- keep it loose
  - crucial for curve of hair
  - do not try to keep tight control over the look of the hair
- directionality and gravity
  - where it is coming from in the head
  - wind and tangent angle matter
- hair volume
  - avoid drawing wet-looking hair by floating it above the head
- masses and shape
  - it has weight and form
- do not draw too many strand lines
  - hair bunches so imply strand details
  - some styles (like American comicbook) have more strand but save for detail
- rough and refined stages
  - the planning stage still applies here (hair is not just details)
  - consider the big shapes and the volume
  - rough involves planning masses (you're still working with forms)
  - refined should focus on smooth lines and especially _overlaps_
  - please _avoid sawtoothing_ in the refined stage
  - above all make sure overlaps read (hair tangents make no sense to viewers)
- stay super loose when you are drawing hair to avoid stiff, wirey hair
- hair seems more complicated than it actually is to draw

## Basic Components of Hair
- consider types of hair
- wavy
  - it's not curly
  - this often is done with straighteners
- straight
  - calm on the top of the head
  - often thin hair
  - any curves are long and gentle
- curly
  - various degrees of curls
  - it could become curly off the scalp
  - it's curly everywhere inside the hair
  - always trying to bend (opposing curves)
  - tighter or looser curls
- short
  - often spiky and fuzzier
  - no weight pulling it downwards
- advice: avoid common novice cartoonist hair mistakes
  - do not stick to one type of hair
  - do not sawtooth your hair (too much manga?)
- consider the strand types
  - pointy: broad base and narrow tip
  - tapering: both ends have a tip but broader mid section
  - straight group: curved on one side and straight on the other
    - this is actually typical of manga unlike the sharp shape associated with it
  - bulbous: tapering on one side, broad base, very broad middle
- the above types are for clumps more than just individual strands

## Basic Hair Shapes
- line strokes
  - separate curves for untidy look
- flicks of hair tapering at both ends
  - give extra hair clumps
  - look like they're coming out from under another section of hair
- swoops
  - come from under one part and goes back into another
  - leave negative space
  - gives interesting style
- front-hair swoops
  - commonly fringing or bangs
  - hair fans out backwards from the top side but comes back and ends visibly
- curls
  - hair continuously rotating in on itself
  - make sure overlaps read clearly
  - think about the shapes and the overlaps
- plaits
  - a continuous braiding shape
  - consider an overlapping pair of angle shapes duplicated over and over
  - there are many types though
  - this is also heavy on overlaps
- vary the size of hair shapes as you keep drawing
  - things will be kind of repetitive but with much variation
- understand the key theory and don't get into the minutiae
- gives a demo showing each of the above shapes added atop a basic style
- during the detail work build up the masses but vary the sizes
- don't stick rigidly to the rough plan
- don't redraw over and over to get the hair right
- instead keep it loose

## Demo: Drawing Hair and Hairstyles
- first has a sketchy, loose, kind of wavy hair
- just a minute or so is enough for the planning phase
- next start underlapping and overlapping hair, avoiding parallels
- now start in on refined, picking points and pulling hair from them
  - instructor tries and retries strokes many times
  - remember volumes so sometimes you can see multiple sides of hair pieces
  - really focus on making overlaps happen
- the first one turned out messy
  - realistic tip: _increase "LOD"_ going into and coming out of the chunks
  - but do not put a bunch of hair strands inside the masses
  - massing should read just as well as overlaps
- second example has hair leafs sprouting up and out
  - you could sprout from anywhere
  - pull some on the sides down to show gravity
  - use bulbous shape for short, spiky style and vary the shapes
  - lighten this a lot for clear overlap visibility
  - hair lines and overlaps don't generally require supporting detail; once in in
- third example will be straight modern hair
  - bangs over forehead in front
  - cover the entire ear
  - suggest straight hair where it's been cut
  - make sure planning includes enough detail to be useful in detail
  - again keep your overlaps in mind and your arm loose
- instructor avoids perfect styling and instead focuses on suggesting style to viewer

## Cloth Dynamics
- cloth dynamics as like hair dynamics
  - stay just as loose as when you draw hair
  - plan the clothing shape before adding folds and overlaps
  - consider gravity when thinking about directionality
  - think about how fabric squashes and stretches
  - avoid sharp points in general, going for round angles or bends
  - consider the _point of tension_: where is the cloth pulled from
  - avoid thickness (double lines in line art) except for thicker forms
  - follow the contour of underlying anatomy
- consider types of folds
  - pipe
    - imagine curtain hanging from top source
    - cylindrical in-out forms following cylinder contour towards bottom
    - long dresses, curtains and generally longer cloth have this
    - pipe folds definitely have overlaps with long lines
  - zigzag
    - moderate compression causes zigzagging
    - wrap overlaps on top of the cylinder (like an arm or any underlying form)
    - show indentation or crinkle with a curve/shadow inside and below a fold
      - these can include nice, deep shadows for lots of compression
    - knees of pants, sports jackets pulled up on the arm, pant leg above shoe
  - spiral
    - constant back-forth tight snake curves yielding a kind of continuous spiral
    - used in cases of heavy compression
    - many more indentation shading shapes
    - plan these folds and avoid symmetrical sides
    - leave room for clothing lines so it doesn't look like a robot part
    - avoid controlling the lines since clothing folds are loose and not neat
    - long falling socks compressing,
  - half lock
    - compression on one side, stretch on the other
    - tight folds at a point of tension
    - tension point is away from folds, like at the elbow
    - areas of expansion are lateral from the tension, compression is opposite
      - imagine lines of expansion from the tension, then compression hypotenuse
    - pay attention to lines from complex points of tension
      - pants don't just spam folds from crotch as often drawn
      - instead, pants have fold lines that tend to go horizontally
    - imagine a bending arm
  - diaper
    - two points of suspension with gravity pulling down
    - fabric folds near the two pinned points
    - then fabric lower down c-curves between the two sides
    - this has to do with center of gravity in the middle of the cloth
    - imagine a knight's tabard, a long rectangular cloth with a neck hole
  - drop
    - easier with just one point
    - this has folds bunching up downward from the pin point
    - the lines can overlap
    - towards the bottom they look like they widen
    - imagine a hanging towel
  - inert
    - infer some energy at some point but now inactive material
    - the kinds of shading shapes used for deep crinkles really come in here
    - imagine a cloth over a ball
- cloth folds aren't as complex to draw as they first appear
- it takes observation to draw clothing well
- but these foundations will help convey believable cloth for characters

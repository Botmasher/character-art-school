# 8. Hair and Cloth Dynamics

## Fundamentals of Drawing Hair
- keep it loose
  - crucial for curve of hair
  - do not try to keep tight control over the look of the hair
- directionality and gravity
  - where it is coming from in the head
  - wind and tangent angle matter
- hair volume
  - avoid drawing wet-looking hair by floating it above the head
- masses and shape
  - it has weight and form
- do not draw too many strand lines
  - hair bunches so imply strand details
  - some styles (like American comicbook) have more strand but save for detail
- rough and refined stages
  - the planning stage still applies here (hair is not just details)
  - consider the big shapes and the volume
  - rough involves planning masses (you're still working with forms)
  - refined should focus on smooth lines and especially _overlaps_
  - please _avoid sawtoothing_ in the refined stage
  - above all make sure overlaps read (hair tangents make no sense to viewers)
- stay super loose when you are drawing hair to avoid stiff, wirey hair
- hair seems more complicated than it actually is to draw

## Basic Components of Hair
- consider types of hair
- wavy
  - it's not curly
  - this often is done with straighteners
- straight
  - calm on the top of the head
  - often thin hair
  - any curves are long and gentle
- curly
  - various degrees of curls
  - it could become curly off the scalp
  - it's curly everywhere inside the hair
  - always trying to bend (opposing curves)
  - tighter or looser curls
- short
  - often spiky and fuzzier
  - no weight pulling it downwards
- advice: avoid common novice cartoonist hair mistakes
  - do not stick to one type of hair
  - do not sawtooth your hair (too much manga?)
- consider the strand types
  - pointy: broad base and narrow tip
  - tapering: both ends have a tip but broader mid section
  - straight group: curved on one side and straight on the other
    - this is actually typical of manga unlike the sharp shape associated with it
  - bulbous: tapering on one side, broad base, very broad middle
- the above types are for clumps more than just individual strands

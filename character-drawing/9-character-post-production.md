# 9. Character Post Production

## Creating Clean Lines and Line Art
- imagine a character running and just randomly summoning a fireball, surprising herself
- instructor reiterates: be loose
  - avoid wrists unless in a small area
  - make lines quick and let them taper
  - dynamic lines again have directionality
  - slow lines lack appeal
- now we're shifting from the rough to refined lines
  - this is a change in our approach
  - FIRST start with _thin_ baselines that are not weighted
  - THEN move to line weighting
  - it is "easier to thicken a line"
- without practice clean lines are tough
  - you will undo or erase less after you practice
  - new layer or paper to do the clean lines
- as instructor goes through, draws long but quick single strokes
- a slight exception: thicker weighting around eyes, with some detail for lashes
- don't get into line weights as much as they might call to you
- Clip Studio Paint has line stabilization
  - me: in my experience GIMP does too
  - instructor also mentions Paint Tool Sai
  - instructor still recommends developing free-hand ability as the better way
- trick: fix how lines look less natural than actual ink on paper
  - digital ends up looking very sharp ("maybe too sharp") and less natural
  - ink bleed gives a vibe
  - so do this:
    - duplicate the final lines layer
    - apply "slight blur" to the lines
  - avoid the razor-sharp "so digital" look by using this technique
  - this is _especially_ obvious once you start coloring

## Creating Rough Clean Lines and Line Art
- what if you want to have rough lines in your finished lines?
  - you could choose a brush with a certain textured look to it
  - or you could try and be rough but controlled in your own lines
- Clip Studio Paint has a "textured pen"
  - this allows you to follow the same steps from the last section
  - it's not alone; Photoshop of course has many options for brushes
- you could do multiple strokes for each single stroke, pulling back from single-long-clean lines
  - doubled, sketchier lines that are still clean have their own appeal
  - high-level detailed paint requires cleaner lines, but this is a style

## Character Page Composition
- consider where characters falls on the page
- "rules of the page" for one character
  - page has borders
  - _rule of thirds_: divide page into 3x3 grid
  - consider where lines intersect
- thirds-based composition: focus on character's head in one of those intersection points
  - this works for "L-shaped" poses
- _iconographic composition_ for single characters though
  - not partially off the page
  - not too big/small
  - keep margin of space framing the character
  - page borders are design elements
- sign and date
  - do not add it in a focal point
  - make it seen but not part of the piece
  - corners or adjacent to piece for completeness
- designers should add website somewhere in the page but keep it light
  - consider writing your name beside your signature

## Final Assignment
- five final character drawings
  - first focus on story and emotions behind each character
  - do preliminary thumbs and take notes
  - full body, thigh-up or bust-up
  - complete including the final line art

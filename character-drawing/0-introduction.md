# Introduction

## 1. Introduction
- very much about practice and taking you to a competent character creator
- recommended to watch through once, then complete activities on second pass
- strike a balance between theory and practice

## 2. Theory Vs Practical
- idea in art: practice every day and do it for years
- but we don't have that time!
- theory as a logical flow like a map to get to the treasure
- make sure theory is ordered in steps that build on each other
- like a checklist that you can use even when practice gets weak

## 3. Let's Get Messy
- seems like a random video but it's an encouragement to be rough and loose
- let go of making perfect drawings
- get fast and messy like a construction site

## 4. Join the Community
- there's a FB group to join
- plus there's support via email

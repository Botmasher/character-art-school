# 6. Character Composition and Design

## Introduction
- theories behind character design beyond just
- this one is more important for successful character design
  - "secret sauce" for "high-end and professional character designs"
- your works are images of characters, not the things in themselves
- how do we make good images of characters?

## Center of Gravity
- keep characters balanced
  - they shouldn't look all tilted
  - they shouldn't look like they're falling over
- the head should align to the character's motion in environment
- keep character head aligned in standing poses:
  - between the legs
  - in line with a single leg
  - look where the feet are and check the gravity pulls between feet or to one foot
- keep character balanced in moving poses:
  - the form's center of gravity should fall to the middle of the feet
  - leaning over to grab something shouldn't have feet way far back
  - where is the bulk of the form?
  - looking to one side leaning over shoulder, body mass still in line with feet
- balanced in really dynamic action:
  - running, flying and other actions should look good in context
  - viewer wiggle room: balance is fine as long as it's contextually right

## Asymmetry in Character Drawing
- over-mirroring
  - if one side of the body is too mirrored it creates strong visual parallels
  - avoid mirroring in poses
- sawtoothing
  - hair or fur are often drawn like repeated sharp triangles
  - avoid this by varying shape, direction and curvature of the pattern
  - do not sawtooth hair or fringes
- parallel curves
  - bounding curves for example in arms as another type of parallel
  - use _straight against curve_
  - instead straighten one side and leave the other curved
  - for example make a tricep straighter and the bicep curved
- tangents without overlaps
  - imagine drawing from chest straight into bicep, leaving a sharp tangent
  - instead we want _overlap_
  - be very careful to include these overlaps in your work
- eliminate these "four evils" from your drawings

## Squash and Stretch
- if mass stretches on one side it squashes on the other
- actuation points
  - if the point moves mechanically, compression happens on one side and stretches
  - this applies very clearly to muscles
  - it applies very strongly to facial expressions, even in small ways (nose)
  - pay attention to the actuation point on the jaw
  - ask where you should be squashing and stretching on many levels
- this isn't as broad for character design as for animation
  - it matters in every scene that's being keyframed
- a tool for persuading the viewer that the character is believable

## Action and Re-action
- _secondary actions_ are actions beyond the primary action of the pose
  - think of the of secondary contingencies of the primary force
  - think of the angle/tilt of the primary line of action
  - students often draw secondary actions as stationary and straight (clothing, hair, blocks)
  - even characters that stand still have secondary things happening
- does hair move, does clothing move even when someone is still?
  - make us believe the character is caught in a snapshot from life
- static secondary elements will dull an otherwise strong piece
- imagine a character standing but casting a spell
  - maybe the character's hair blows back as a secondary action
  - maybe the character is moving forward towards the spell but the clothing is reacting
  - maybe the character wears jewels that flail back while character moves
- even the background elements can react to the primary action

## Gender and Age Differences
- drawing masculinity and femininity in your characters
- rigid angles vs curvier lines
- narrower pelvis vs wider pelvis
- broader shoulders vs narrower shoulders
- thicker neck vs thinner neck
- smaller eyes vs bigger eyes
- bigger nose vs smaller nose
- 8 head female vs 6 head child
  - compress torso first to show age difference
  - then other proportions should compress following that
  - head size though stays similar
  - _or_ increase head size to look younger
- forehead size indicates age
  - shortening as character ages
  - babies with facial features low on face and massive foreheads
- remember these can pull a character in a direction
  - general guidelines, not things to avoid at all costs
  - mix and match unless you're aiming for something stereotypical

## Character Design Essentials
- what is your _vision_: idea, feel, story
  - keep asking yourself this as you design
  - this is not a mental image instead it's the _who_ of the character
  - people should believe this character
- bad ideas drawn well are bad ideas, good ideas drawn badly are still good ideas
- things to ask while drawing
  - what is the character thinking or feeling?
    - not "holding a glass of water" but "what a race, I'm sooo thirsty!"
  - what are their names, contexts, aspirations?
    - not "sad with slumped shoulders" but "just lost her dog"
  - what do they feel their goals or purposes are?
    - act out or inhabit the character to tell their story
- avoid clichés
  - a cliché is a symbolic parallel
  - add a twist if you're in a genre or universe
  - we have such a small window of time to capture a viewer
  - give them not a good drawing but a believable world and character

## Points of Focus
- rule of thirds for the "picture plane"
  - it's just one system
  - but you can use one of a few systems to divide up a page
- problem: composing a character doesn't work this way
  - it works when laying out a character in an environment
  - composing good characters requires thinking differently
- focal points
  - the head is primary
  - secondary is the hands
- avoid messing up the whole piece:
  - so draw the head and the face well
  - also get really good at hands ("it's time, people!")
  - awesome body won't overcome bad head and hands
- create a visual loop
  - viewer looks at the head
  - viewer looks at the hands but those lead back to the head...
  - this can be done with other art too so pay attention for loops
- facial composition
  - eyes are the first focal point
  - mouth is second focal point
  - loops are harder but mouth should back up the eye expression
  - the body then supports those eye and mouth expressions

## Making Characters Unique
- what makes someone iconic?
  - what's one thing you could change would completely remove the character's aesthetic?
  - what defines who the character is?
- this moves towards getting "a look" for a character
- iconographic hair styles and clothing that sets character apart
  - definitive elements
  - what are the primary definitive elements?
- distill the character to that one thing that you can add or subtract
- "What one thing, if I removed it, would have my character cease to be iconic?"

## Utilizing Symbolism
- square, circle, triangle convey shape meaning
- rectangular shapes as sturdy, strong, powerful, dependable
- circular shapes as friendly, soft, cute, gentle
- triangular shapes as sharp, mysterious, dangerous
- examples of a single face with elements of these shapes

## Silhouette
- silhouette values are good when they read clearly and make sense
- you should be able to tell what characters and objects are from the silhouette
- this adds weight to believability
- your character's pose and elements should read in silhouette
- avoid flyswatting problem
  - do _not_ start drawing every component outside of the form
  - this makes characters look hit by a flyswatter
  - the silhouette and the forms should read well and believably
- instead draw with overlaps to introduce depth
  - you can hide an arm behind the back or one leg behind another
  - balance silhouette value and overlaps
- look at real-life examples to see what kind of values good silhouettes have

## The Three Core Elements of Character Design
- always focus on these three things when drawing characters
1. facial expression
  - the head is the primary focal point in the piece
  - the face must read clearly
2. pose
  - support the feeling of the facial expression with the pose
  - this must have a good silhouette
  - the pose must have dynamism, opposing curves and be theoretically correct
  - do not master the head and avoid the pose
3. clothing and accessories
  - these tell the viewer about the character's world
  - what are their colors, styles, ...
- the workflow you adopt should make sure these tie in to your idea
- cover your bases here and check yourself on these points
- these points also translate to design generally

## The 5 Core Elements of Character Composition
- artists lean on references too much or just can't imagine / figure out poses
- instead commit these five guidelines to memory
1. primary and secondary lines of action
2. horizontal and vertical tilts
3. twisting elements
4. foreshortening
5. multiple object overlaps
- include all of them in your character for a dynamic pose
  - make sure to stick to theory as well
  - check box each one to make sure you have it in
1. lines of action
  - rhythmic flow through primary line running through secondary ones
  - no strong breaks countering the flow
  - forms should follow this flow using opposing curves
2. tilts
  - horizontal eye, shoulder, pelvic, knee lines should not be parallel
  - this keeps the figure from feeling static
3. twisting elements
  - often students draw every element facing the same direction
  - pay attention to plane normals for head, chest, pelvis, knees
  - add rotations to elements
  - simple example: take a head and twist it to face the other way
  - smaller things like wrists and forearms can twist
  - add dynamism by twisting things every which way
  - this is subtle and doesn't require adding much detail
4. foreshortening
  - instead of twisting hand up towards arm, bring hand closer to the viewer
  - then the hand is bigger and overlaps the arm, the arm is shortened
  - size body elements based on distance
  - extreme foreshortening adds lots of drama
    - like a fist punching toward camera
    - or a sword from hand towards camera
  - recommended to add 1-3 foreshortened elements per piece
5. overlaps
  - a couple of overlaps aren't interesting enough
  - hair can overlap heads, clothing can overlap, arms can overlap
  - circle and count overlaps
  - have a bunch of large overlaps to imply depth
- make sure to do these five things to level up your art
- do drawovers of some of your favorite pieces and look for improvements
  - what are the lines of action?
  - tilts: generally if you don't have horizontal you avoid vertical
  - is there no major twisting?
    - in the roughs introduce some big twists
  - foreshortening: avoids parallel lines in things like rect props
  - overlaps: start with head and work around body, paying attention to limbs
- this all adds dynamism to the piece
  - overlaps do great work _but_ balance with the silhouette
  - remember, how well do the silhouette values read?
- follow these five and check the boxes
  - these don't replace reference material but they do help draw common poses

## Using All Your Knowledge
- make sure you use all of the theory so far
- don't be wasteful, if you could have used some piece of theory, why skip it?
- story and emotion as elements that make your characters great

## Module 6 Assignments
- create a checklist of all the theories, then draw 5 character pieces
- then draw 5 more character pieces, as professionally as possible, waist-up only

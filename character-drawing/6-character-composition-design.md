# 6. Character Composition and Design

## Introduction
- theories behind character design beyond just
- this one is more important for successful character design
  - "secret sauce" for "high-end and professional character designs"
- your works are images of characters, not the things in themselves
- how do we make good images of characters?

## Center of Gravity
- keep characters balanced
  - they shouldn't look all tilted
  - they shouldn't look like they're falling over
- the head should align to the character's motion in environment
- keep character head aligned in standing poses:
  - between the legs
  - in line with a single leg
  - look where the feet are and check the gravity pulls between feet or to one foot
- keep character balanced in moving poses:
  - the form's center of gravity should fall to the middle of the feet
  - leaning over to grab something shouldn't have feet way far back
  - where is the bulk of the form?
  - looking to one side leaning over shoulder, body mass still in line with feet
- balanced in really dynamic action:
  - running, flying and other actions should look good in context
  - viewer wiggle room: balance is fine as long as it's contextually right

## Asymmetry in Character Drawing
- over-mirroring
  - if one side of the body is too mirrored it creates strong visual parallels
  - avoid mirroring in poses
- sawtoothing
  - hair or fur are often drawn like repeated sharp triangles
  - avoid this by varying shape, direction and curvature of the pattern
  - do not sawtooth hair or fringes
- parallel curves
  - bounding curves for example in arms as another type of parallel
  - use _straight against curve_
  - instead straighten one side and leave the other curved
  - for example make a tricep straighter and the bicep curved
- tangents without overlaps
  - imagine drawing from chest straight into bicep, leaving a sharp tangent
  - instead we want _overlap_
  - be very careful to include these overlaps in your work
- eliminate these "four evils" from your drawings

## Squash and Stretch
- if mass stretches on one side it squashes on the other
- actuation points
  - if the point moves mechanically, compression happens on one side and stretches
  - this applies very clearly to muscles
  - it applies very strongly to facial expressions, even in small ways (nose)
  - pay attention to the actuation point on the jaw
  - ask where you should be squashing and stretching on many levels
- this isn't as broad for character design as for animation
  - it matters in every scene that's being keyframed
- a tool for persuading the viewer that the character is believable

## Action and Re-action
- _secondary actions_ are actions beyond the primary action of the pose
  - think of the of secondary contingencies of the primary force
  - think of the angle/tilt of the primary line of action
  - students often draw secondary actions as stationary and straight (clothing, hair, blocks)
  - even characters that stand still have secondary things happening
- does hair move, does clothing move even when someone is still?
  - make us believe the character is caught in a snapshot from life
- static secondary elements will dull an otherwise strong piece
- imagine a character standing but casting a spell
  - maybe the character's hair blows back as a secondary action
  - maybe the character is moving forward towards the spell but the clothing is reacting
  - maybe the character wears jewels that flail back while character moves
- even the background elements can react to the primary action

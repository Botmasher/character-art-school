# 5. Character Drawing Workflows

## Workflow 1: Two Stage Workflow
- rough and refined stages for character drawing
  - please verify that you understand both of these stages
  - implement theory to get nice piece of character art
  - revisit this after you have done module 6 (the next module) for more theory
- two stages are _construction_ (or _planning_) and _rendering_ (or _implementing_)
  - construction is for planning the drawing
  - rendering is for drawing the drawing
  - this gets our theory applied in a logical way
- messy construction of a face vs a decent finished lineart for the portrait
- why in the instructor's examples is there a gap btwn rough and very detailed?
  - planning details will be dealt with going through this module
  - switching mindset matters when doing construction vs detail
  - students try to be neat at the outset
  - save the good looks for the refined stage
- once you have a strong foundation, be free to add detail like a new layer
- keep reiterating because students don't implement the way instructor expects:
  - start rough, loose, theoretical like a messy construction site
  - after that start adding the fine touches that make the finished project

## Workflow 2: Multi-Stage Workflow
- break the workflow into doable pieces
  - the ordered steps you will take
  - these steps keep you focused on your goal and from getting lost in your work
- theoretical breakdown: rough vs refined
- general art theory: shape, form, detail
- combine both to get informed stages:
  - rough: shape, form, detail
    - rough shape: gesture, opposing curves, loose lines
    - rough form: 3D, drawing through, dynamic forms (also informed by shape)
    - rough detail: anatomy, features, clothing, props, color/style
  - refined: clean lines, coloring, composition
    - clean the whole drawing up
    - many people can already do this
    - this is only 10% of the theory but 80% of the time
- combine all those steps into four main (rough shape-form-detail -> refined)
  1. dynamic forms
  2. rough details
  3. refined rough (messy but reads clearly)
  4. clean-up drawing

## DEMO: Multi-Stage Workflow
- speed demo for those four stages above
  - leave out the theory from the next module
  - really focus on workflow rather than the specifics
- remember: dynamic forms, rough details, refined rough, cleanup
- me: some points that stood out during the drawing
  - first stage: dynamic forms
    - start with the big masses and work out the forms
    - measure the gestural angles/tilts
    - know what you're going for
    - flip back and forth
    - make sure all the big masses are in (like clothing shapes)
    - make sure you've done all the dynamic work
  - second stage: rough details
    - lower opacity and start getting all general elements in
    - avoid the hair and face other than indicators
    - do not detail the details just get them in
    - everything can be changed (tilt, leg and arm placement)
    - each stage should make sense on its own given the theories
    - majority of costume detail shapes should be in
  - third stage: refined rough
    - think about what you're doing: when are you using shape vs form theories?
    - make changes here (everything is still changeable)
    - is the dynamism coming through?
    - check for parallels (shape theory) and proportions (anatomy)
    - do not make it look good, make it theoretically correct
    - messy is still good at this stage
    - adding some facial details
  - fourth stage: cleanup
    - get straight, directional lines
    - no sketchy or rough lines unless that is the deliberate style
    - loose arm and clean dynamic lines
    - lines that look good rather than planned lines
    - closer to tracing your own previous stages
    - enhance what you defined in the previous stages
    - thin lines so that you can weight up lines
    - think about overlaps and make sure they read
    - now line weighting: overlaps
    - later module covering weightening but here's the basics:
      - thicker lines around closer objects like the head in front of the neck
      - underlying lines (being overlapped) have hook shadows
    - this stage does take time but does require much deliberation
      - it must be built on good structure or it will not look good
- focus on getting workflow down

## DEMO: Realtime Workflow
- observing workflow in action for a couple hours
- this is the same one that was timelapsed for the multi-stage demo
- instructor is quick with strokes but deliberate and slow with timing
- lots of undos
- me: skipped forward a lot and watched pieces for a while

## Finding Your Ideal Workflow
- have ideas and breakdown for building your own workflow
- you could get more specific, starting with a shape-based lifelike gesture, ...
- figure out which theories work best for you
- two-stage workflows combine many theories together
  - form for body but shape for limbs if already know how to
  - tweak and mold to get theories towards your goals (push gesture, push anatomy)
- no workflow is perfect and everyone has their own
  - this can be used as your foundation

## Module 5 Assignments
- see resources for one four-stage and one two-stage workflow assignment
- these are ongoing, asking you to do 20 characters in four-stage before trying two-stage
- consider each a "mark of progress" rather than "an end in itself"

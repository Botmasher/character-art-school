# 10. Comprehensive Character Demos

## Intro to Character Demos
- two types of demos: shorter timelapse for gist vs long with only refinement timelapsed
- this will be updated with demos over time
- for reference and downloading yourself

## Carmi
- a "magic girl" for a mobile RPG for western audiences with a "cute" style
- watch the workflow
- usually starts with head and works down and out from there
- very rough with normal body forms
- drawing s-shaped magic hat and starting with idea of spectacles
  - "exploring the look" while drawing
- skirt, shirt, tights all getting drawn in
- _ghosting_ (comic term) when erasing lines and drawing over
- rotating character and parts of character (torso) to capture drama
  - keep tweaking tilts to convey and push the pose
- sketch in general details
- check through elements from module six (twists, lines, overlaps, ...)
- uses a large page (A3)
- shift from rough to refined
  - it's not about structure, it's about lines and overlaps reading
  - keep lines loose
  - this is a "design mindset" to think about shapes you're making
- basic lines first then weighting
- could spend half hour on eyes because "the eyes have to read well"
  - even after line art for the mouth, returns to eyes
  - adds an extra circle kind of like "two irises", not quite, but personal style
- zoom in and out to check the read at a distance
- if you want to do a refined rough, you'll basically trace on the third clean-up phase
  - that's like traditional pen and paper, lightbox, trace over
- less undos now than previously after years of practice
- this is the thin line stage, once done move onto the weighting and shading
  - hook shading with overlaps
  - emphasize the overlaps

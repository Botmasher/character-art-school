# 10. Comprehensive Character Demos

## Intro to Character Demos
- two types of demos: shorter timelapse for gist vs long with only refinement timelapsed
- this will be updated with demos over time
- for reference and downloading yourself

## Carmi
- a "magic girl" for a mobile RPG for western audiences with a "cute" style
- watch the workflow
- usually starts with head and works down and out from there
- very rough with normal body forms
- drawing s-shaped magic hat and starting with idea of spectacles
  - "exploring the look" while drawing
- skirt, shirt, tights all getting drawn in
- _ghosting_ (comic term) when erasing lines and drawing over
- rotating character and parts of character (torso) to capture drama
  - keep tweaking tilts to convey and push the pose
- sketch in general details
- check through elements from module six (twists, lines, overlaps, ...)
- uses a large page (A3)
- shift from rough to refined
  - it's not about structure, it's about lines and overlaps reading
  - keep lines loose
  - this is a "design mindset" to think about shapes you're making
- basic lines first then weighting
- could spend half hour on eyes because "the eyes have to read well"
  - even after line art for the mouth, returns to eyes
  - adds an extra circle kind of like "two irises", not quite, but personal style
- zoom in and out to check the read at a distance
- if you want to do a refined rough, you'll basically trace on the third clean-up phase
  - that's like traditional pen and paper, lightbox, trace over
- less undos now than previously after years of practice
- this is the thin line stage, once done move onto the weighting and shading
  - hook shading with overlaps
  - emphasize the overlaps

## ChronoViper
- starts with form, tilts to capture gesture
- focus on arms and overlaps to show off the large held object
- braids swinging out into ponytail as special feature
- make sure the features and shapes are reading as silhouettes
  - this is part of simultaneous shape-form workflow
  - shape as much of fundamentals here
  - any seeming details at this point are focused on readability
- dealing with industrial design (mechanical structures and items)
  - first get planks or straight-edge forms in there
  - then adjust lines to shape it and get it to read
  - you can then start to rough in more specific shapes
  - use a guideline to keep lines straight and parallel (no skew!)
  - you may end up adding more detail so next stage has foundational elements
- keep asking: is this shape, form or detail?
- more industrial/mechanical detail and overlaps across the body in the rough
  - make sure you're still keeping it free and iterating
  - _but_ also make sure you've got the right proportions and shapes
- rough considerations: make sure you run through checklists
  - which way is wind blowing? is hair and clothing blowing that way?
  - do the mechanical elements all look right?
  - ...
- now stage for going over and tightening foundation
- composition: what points to what? what needs adjusting?
  - here instructor adjusts ponytail and adds dagger to point to character face
  - hold attention in the piece
  - adds subelement to industrial element only to refashion it
  - make sure to keep believability (like if element needs a mount or something)
- do a form check, sketching out the character's forms on a layer
  - avoid back arching past what's humanly possible
  - instructor took a bit over 2h to get to this point
  - anatomical gesture drawings make sure you can do well by this point
- refinement: now it's a detailing rough stage
  - should character have extra elements?
  - shift your mind out of construction
  - avoid theory and be free and creative (you can make changes to your plans!)
- get in the lines
  - even do line weighting around the face to make sure that reads
  - the rest are light and basic
  - the rest of the line weighting will be done on another pass
- then use lighting knowledge to add texture
  - this especially because the character will not be painted
- detail on the hair and notably braids
  - use tools to speed up your work (like copy + warp tools for braid pattern)
- fill in elements like emblem for detail
- instructor makes interesting decisions around belts, ribbons, small details
- get in the unique elements around teleportation minipads
- go back and fix hair angles, overlaps, weights
  - creases and braids
- lights and shadows comic style
  - use shapes, giving "implied detail"
  - definitely take a look at this to get a sense for how it works
- get better: really focus on the foundations throughout the course
  - do not get overwhelmed by the details

# Character Art School

My notes, thoughts and activities from working through Character Art School modules on Udemy.

## Background
I'm enrolled in and taking the [Complete Character Drawing](https://www.udemy.com/character-art-school-complete-character-drawing/) course. I'm doing this make good on a professional commitment to up the quality of my work. We'll see if I pursue any others from this same instructor after that.

## Organization
Repo directories off of root contain work for individual courses. At present, the course I'm taking is the character drawing one mentioned above. Work within each directory will include notes and relevant text (thoughts, answers, ...) for each module. Activities are stored in a separate subdirectory.

```

## Terminology
At least for the character drawing course, Udemy section numbers are out of sync with course modules. Complete Character Drawing Module 1 begins in section 2. The course uses the terms "modules" and "activities" rather than "sections" and "exercises". I'm following the instructor's module numbering in this repo instead of the Udemy count.
